# ── Jamf Platform gateway coverage ────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Which Jamf Pro and Classic endpoints the platform gateway publishes. Derived
# into the committed specs/gateway/coverage.json, which the generator reads to
# stamp a jamf:gateway annotation on the commands outside that surface — so
# `pro api-roles list` on a platform profile is refused with an explanation
# instead of the gateway's 403 BAD_PERMISSIONS, which is byte-identical to a
# missing API-role privilege.
#
# The source is jamfplatform-go-sdk's api/, the same place specs/platform/ comes
# from: pro_api.json and classic_api_resource_documentation.json, listed above as
# PLATFORM_SDK_COVERAGE_SPECS. Both are complete as of SDK adb8d7b (528 and 273
# paths, method-for-method identical to the gateway's own drops) and each
# operation carries x-required-privileges in the gateway scope vocabulary.
#
# That last part is why the SDK is now sufficient alone. Coverage was previously
# derived from the jamf/public-apis-oas GitOps bundle, because only its
# _permissions/routes.yaml carried the scope map. The SDK's x-required-privileges
# now reproduces it exactly — 1352 operations, zero disagreements, none on either
# side alone — so the bundle route is gone rather than kept as a second path
# nothing exercises.
#
# The manifest is committed so `make generate` and CI stay hermetic: nobody needs
# an SDK checkout to build, and the drop directory is gitignored.
#
# The same run also derives specs/classic/schemas.json, the Classic API request-body
# schemas behind --scaffold, --set and the required/enum help on classic write
# commands (see generator/classicschema). Same source spec, same drop directory,
# same hermetic-artifact reasoning — so one flag, not two: a second flag that has
# to carry the same value is a code path nothing exercises on its own.
#
# And specs/AppInstaller*.yaml, for the same reason again (see
# monolith.ExtractSubtree). App Installers sits under hiddenapi/ in jamf/jss, so
# neither the jss bundle nor an instance's own /api/schema/ carries it, and
# pro_api.json is the only published spec that does — the specs this repo used
# before it was published were reverse-engineered. They are written before the
# spec glob so the same invocation regenerates the commands they describe.

# If JAMF_MONOLITH_SPEC is set, the monolith is split into per-resource spec
# files before parsing, preserving the existing filename layout.
# Generated code is formatted by the toolchain go.mod declares, not by whatever
# `go` happens to be on PATH, because gofmt's alignment rules move between
# releases. Go 1.26 breaks a map literal's alignment group at a long key where
# 1.27 keeps one group, so the same tree regenerated on the two toolchains
# differs in a handful of files — and CI reads `go-version-file: go.mod`, so
# `make verify-generated` failed there on a whitespace diff that reproduced
# nowhere locally. Worse on 1.26: one gofmt pass over the generator's output was
# not a fixed point there, so whether the check passed came down to how many
# times gofmt had historically run over the committed copy.
#
# GOTOOLCHAIN=auto (the default) treats go.mod's version as a *minimum*, so a
# newer local toolchain is picked up silently and the drift is invisible until
# CI. Naming it exactly is what makes the artifact reproducible; the toolchain is
# downloaded once and cached, and it is the same one CI runs. Keep this pinned
# even while go.mod and every developer agree — agreement is what it is for.
