# Syncing OpenAPI Specs

This document describes how to update the CLI when a new Jamf Pro Server version is released.

There are two independent sources for the Jamf Pro API specs, and two matching
sync routes:

| Source | Route | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `jamf/jss` monorepo (`**/swagger_docs/uapi/*.yaml`) | `make sync-specs` | You have a server repo checkout at the release tag |
| A live instance's consolidated `/api/schema/` document | `make sync-spec` | You only have an instance running the target version |

Both routes end in `make generate` and both write the version to
`specs/.spec-version`.

## Prerequisites

- Go toolchain matching `go.mod`
- For `sync-specs`: a `jamf/jss` checkout at the release tag
- For `sync-spec`: credentials for an instance on the target version

## Option A: from the jamf/jss monorepo

### Automated (GitHub Actions)

```bash
gh workflow run sync-specs.yaml \
  -f jamf_pro_version=11.31.0 \
  -f server_repo_ref=11.31.0-t1785774933693
```

### Manual (local)

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/jss-sparse && cd /tmp/jss-sparse
git clone --no-checkout --depth 1 --filter=blob:none \
  --branch <tag> https://github.com/jamf/jss.git jamf-pro-server
cd jamf-pro-server
git sparse-checkout set --no-cone '**/swagger_docs/uapi/*.yaml'
git checkout
```

Specs are scattered across subdirectories in the jss repo (not a single folder). The sparse-checkout pattern `**/swagger_docs/uapi/*.yaml` collects them all.

Then, from this repo:

```bash
make sync-specs JAMF_SERVER_PATH=/tmp/jss-sparse JAMF_PRO_VERSION=11.31.0
```

`JAMF_SERVER_PATH` is the directory *containing* the checkout — the target reads
specs from `$JAMF_SERVER_PATH/jamf-pro-server/**/swagger_docs/uapi/`, which is
why the clone above lands in a `jamf-pro-server` subdirectory.

`JAMF_PRO_VERSION` is mandatory — it is what `specs/.spec-version` (and therefore
`jamf-cli version`) reports.

Both sync targets check the format and stop before they change anything if it does
not match. Accepted values are three dot-separated numbers, with an optional build
suffix:

- `11.31.0`
- `11.31.0-t1785774933693` — the form `/api/v1/jamf-pro-version` returns on a
  non-GA instance

Anything else is rejected, including a value that carries whitespace.

## Option B: from a live instance's consolidated schema

The public `/api/schema/` endpoint serves one consolidated OpenAPI document.
`make sync-spec` splits it back into the per-resource layout under `specs/`.

```bash
# 1. Fetch (needs auth)
TOKEN=$(bin/jamf-cli -p <profile> pro auth token --field token --quiet)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  https://<instance>/api/schema/ -o /tmp/monolith.json

# 2. Confirm the version you are ingesting
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  https://<instance>/api/v1/jamf-pro-version

# 3. Split and regenerate
make sync-spec JAMF_MONOLITH_SPEC=/tmp/monolith.json JAMF_PRO_VERSION=11.31.0
```

`JAMF_MONOLITH_SPEC` also accepts an `http(s)://` URL directly.

Splitter behaviour and its knobs live in `generator/monolith/`:

- **Routing** — each path goes to the spec file that already owns it. Genuinely
  new paths fall through to `TagFilenameOverrides[tag]` → the file that already
  owns other paths with the same tag → `PascalSingular(tag).yaml`. Every
  fall-through is reported as a `Warning:` line, so read the generator output.
- **`DroppedTags`** — tags never emitted (legacy preview endpoints that shadow a
  canonical resource).
- **`PreservedSpecs`** — spec files sourced outside the public monolith. The
  splitter leaves these files alone and treats their paths as invisible, so the
  monolith cannot clobber them. Library files they `$ref` are auto-preserved.
  The four `specs/AppInstaller*.yaml` are the current members: App Installers
  sits under `hiddenapi/` in Jamf Pro's source, so no monolith carries it, and
  those files are derived from the gateway's published Pro API spec by
  `monolith.ExtractSubtree` — see `make sync-platform-specs-from-sdk`.
- **Components** — a schema used by one spec file is inlined into it; a schema
  shared by two or more is emitted to `specs/_MonolithLibrary.yaml` and
  referenced by external `$ref`.

The public monolith is a subset of the monorepo specs, so Option B legitimately
produces fewer paths than Option A. Do not "fix" a missing private endpoint by
hand-editing a generated spec — add it to `PreservedSpecs` instead.

## After either route

```bash
make test
make lint
make build
```

### 1. Group any new commands

A brand new tag becomes a brand new resource command, which trips
`TestApplyProGroups_AllCommandsGrouped`. Add it to `proGroupMap` in
`internal/commands/groups.go`; the test failure names the command.

### 2. Sanity-check auto-derived resource names

Resource names come from the spec filename and are auto-pluralized. When that
reads wrong — a collective noun or a double `s` — add an entry to
`resourceNameOverrides` in `generator/parser/parser.go` and regenerate. Getting
this right before the command ships is much cheaper than renaming it later.

A single-valued endpoint needs the *verb* fixed too, not just the noun: a
GET-only settings-style path with no `{id}` has no PUT for `detectSingleton` to
match, so it generates `list` (plus a meaningless `--field id` example) for an
endpoint that returns one object. Add its path to `readOnlySingletonPaths` in
the same file — that makes it a singleton, which also drops the pluralization,
so no `resourceNameOverrides` entry is needed.

### 3. Check for privilege-name changes

Upstream sometimes renames a privilege (11.31.0 turned `Read Activation Code`
into `Read License Information`). Those strings are surfaced verbatim in
`commands -o json` as `privileges` and appended to the 403 hint at runtime, so a
downstream consumer can break on an otherwise routine sync:

```bash
git diff -- specs/ | grep -E '^[-+].*x-required-privileges' -A 3
```

Call out anything that moved in the PR body.

### 4. Check whether any new endpoint documents a non-2xx as a *result*

Almost every operation lists a 403 as a boilerplate error, but a few
check-style endpoints (e.g. DigiCert's `privilege-check`) return 403 *as the
answer*, with the body holding the detail the user asked for. Left alone, the
client maps that to `permission_denied` with a hint blaming the caller's own API
role, and the payload only ever appears inside an error string. Add the
operation to `documentedStatusResults` in `generator/parser/parser.go` and
regenerate — the command then renders the body and picks its own exit code.

### 5. Manual testing

Exercise the new and changed endpoints against a live instance on the target
version, not just `--help`:

```bash
bin/jamf-cli -p <profile> pro computers list
bin/jamf-cli -p <profile> pro mobile-devices list
```

### 6. Commit

```bash
git add specs/ internal/commands/pro/generated/ internal/commands/groups.go
git commit -m "feat: sync specs with Jamf Pro v11.31.0"
```

## Version tracking

`specs/.spec-version` contains the Jamf Pro version the specs were synced from.
The Makefile reads it into the binary as `main.specProVersion`, surfaced by
`jamf-cli version`. Both sync routes and the GitHub Action write it.

## Generated files

The generator creates files in `internal/commands/pro/generated/`:

- One file per API resource (e.g., `computers.go`, `scripts.go`)
- `registry.go` — registers all modern API commands
- `classic_registry.go` — registers all Classic API commands
- `smoke_registry.go` — every GET, for smoke tests
- `backup_registry.go` — list+get pairs consumed by `backup`/`diff`
- `provenance.go` — SHA256 of every source spec

`make verify-generated` deletes and regenerates the package, then fails if the
result differs from what is committed. It compares against `HEAD`, so run it on
a clean tree (or after committing).

## Troubleshooting

### Generator fails

Check that specs are valid YAML:

```bash
go run ./generator --specs ./specs --output ./internal/commands/pro/generated
```

Some specs fail to parse due to missing `$ref` targets or schema issues — these are skipped with an error message. This is expected for specs that reference shared definition libraries not included in the uapi directory.

### New endpoints not appearing

The generator only creates commands for endpoints with supported HTTP methods
(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) on a path that belongs to the spec file's
canonical prefix family. Paths outside that family are reported as
`Warning: ... not in canonical prefix family — skipped`. Check the generator
output before assuming the spec is at fault.

### Ungrouped commands

After adding new specs, run `make test`. `TestApplyProGroups_AllCommandsGrouped` will fail and list every command that needs a group assignment in `groups.go`.
