"""Report which mutating gateway requests this CLI sends are covered by a Tyk audit rule.

The gateway's audit rules are path globs, and a request that is routed but
unaudited succeeds silently — the mutation happens and nothing records it. That
failure mode already bit once: Security Cloud URLs were version-first, which
matched no glob, so 19 of 27 mutating operations executed unaudited for weeks
(docs/solutions/logic-errors/securitycloud-tenant-first-url-audit-2026-08-21.md).

The scope has since moved into an X-Tenant-Id header and every generated path
changed shape, so coverage has to be recomputed rather than assumed. This script
does that by simulating the real matcher rather than reasoning about it:

  - glob semantics from jamf/tyk-custom-plugins/plugins/audit-plugin/rules.go
    (CompileGlob: "**" -> ".+", "*" -> "[^/]+", everything else literal, anchored)
  - the matched path is stripListenPath(request path, listen_path), i.e. the raw
    inbound path with the product's listen_path removed, before any rewriting
  - request paths are read out of the generated commands, so this measures what
    the CLI actually sends, with EDGE_PREFIX added back on to model the GA edge
    (see the constant — the CLI no longer sends /api, but Tyk still listens on it)

Usage:
    python3 scripts/audit-coverage.py [path-to-tyk-gateway-management] [git-ref]

Defaults to /Users/Shared/GitHub/jamf/tyk-gateway-management at HEAD. Pass a ref
when the local checkout is behind the deployed state — a stale checkout is the
easiest way to draw the wrong conclusion here, and the script prints which ref it
read so the answer is attributable.

Exits non-zero when any mutating request the CLI sends is unaudited.

# What the GA edge adds before Tyk sees the request.
#
# The CLI stopped sending /api at GA: {region}.api.jamfcloud.com serves
# /blueprints/v1/blueprints and answers 404 for /api/blueprints/v1/blueprints
# (wire-checked 2026-08-28, EU, every namespace). Tyk did not move — prod's
# api-definitions still declare listen_path: /api/{namespace} and none declares
# a bare /{namespace} — so the new CloudFront edge is prefixing /api ahead of
# the gateway. That is also the only reading consistent with every namespace
# returning byte-identical statuses on the new host, pre-existing failures
# included: the same gateway behind a different edge, not a re-implementation.
#
# So the audited path is still the /api form, and coverage is unchanged by the
# CLI dropping the segment. Matching the CLI's own outbound path against
# listen_path directly would report all 45 mutations as unrouted — a false
# alarm about the loudest possible failure. If Tyk later gains bare
# /{namespace} listen paths, set this to "" and re-run: the answer must come
# from the deployed definitions, not from this constant.
