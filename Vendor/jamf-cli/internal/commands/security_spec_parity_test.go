// TestSecurityCloudSpecParity asserts every operation in the Security Cloud
// specs reaches the CLI as a subcommand.
//
// The generator emits only the HTTP methods its template handles
// (filterGenerableOps) and drops the rest without a warning. That is how PUT
// went missing: no platform spec had used it, so five operations — including
// the only way to set a DNS search domain — silently never generated, and the
// resources looked complete because every other verb was present.
//
// Security Cloud specs are refreshed often and from a repo this one does not
// control, so a refresh introducing an unhandled method, or a tag rename that
// leaves a resource unwired, has to fail here rather than quietly shrink the
// command tree. Counts, not names: this is a coverage check, and the per-name
// checks live in TestSecurityGatewayServedCommandsPresent.
//
// The count is of distinct *endpoints*, not raw spec operations: where a spec
// declares the same endpoint at two API versions, deduplicateVersionedOps keeps
// only the highest and it ships as one command. Counting operations instead made
// the arrival of a second version look like a regression — device groups
// publishing a v2 list alongside the deprecated v1 turned this test red while
// the command tree was in fact correct.
//
// Synthesized verbs are excluded, for the same reason and in the other
// direction. `apply` is composed from a resource's list, create and update
// rather than mapped from an operation of its own, so it has no endpoint to
// pair with and counting it made six correctly-generated commands look like six
// spec operations that had gone missing. They are named rather than detected so
// that a *spec* operation arriving under one of these names still counts — the
// exclusion is of the generator's own inventions, not of the words.
// versionSegments matches an API version path segment wherever it sits, the
// same shape generator/parser's stripVersionSegments removes.

// operations instead of mapping from one, so they have no spec endpoint to be
// counted against. See applySpec in generator/platform/emitter.go.
