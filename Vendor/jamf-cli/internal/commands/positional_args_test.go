// a caller could not paste them either. scope.Resource carries the CLI name
// now and the examples are whole invocations, which is what brought them into
// this test's population rather than out of it.
//
// It was 21. The third was `pro computer-groups get`, which sat in the second of
// two identical computer-groups subtrees — the generated registry called
// NewComputerGroupsCmd twice, so `pro --help` printed the row twice and Find
// resolved every path under it to the first copy. Resource identity comes from
// the spec's paths and tags now rather than from two filenames that named the
// same resource, so there is one subtree and the example resolves to its own
// leaf. A registry defect, fixed by removing what caused it.
//
// Thirteen more arrived with the nested sub-resource split, and for those the
// mismatch is the point: each is a leaf under a hidden compatibility stub
// (`pro sso-settings-cert update`, `pro self-service-settings get` and the rest
// of nestedAliases), built by calling the nested resource's own constructor, so
// its Example correctly names the live path — `pro sso-settings cert update` —
// which resolves to a different leaf. A stub whose --help taught its own dead
// name would be the defect. Their arity is still covered, once, on the leaf the
