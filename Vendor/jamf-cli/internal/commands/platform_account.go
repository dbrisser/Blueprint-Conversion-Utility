// The fault is jamf-account's own call to the Skyway distributor service, and it
// has surfaced in two forms without the surface becoming usable in between:
//
//   - Until at least 2026-08-27, an OAuth error on a resource path:
//     400 {"error":"invalid_scope","error_description":"Invalid scopes:
//     skyway-use2-product"}. That is not the caller's scope. The gateway's own
//     /auth/token echoes back verbatim whatever scope was requested and refuses
//     it, so the string names what jamf-account asked *its* issuer for — and
//     `use2` is the dev deployment, where prod's Skyway definitions are use1.
//     Probed 2026-08-31: skyway-use1-product, skyway-product and
//     account-api-external-product-us are all refused identically from
//     us.api.jamfcloud.com/auth/token, and prod's Skyway api-definitions are
//     tagged internal-use1 against a different JWT source, so no external
//     customer or distributor credential can hold one.
//   - As of 2026-09-01, the account service's own envelope:
//     400 [UPSTREAM_ERROR] "Failed to <verb> ... via Skyway distributor
//     service", identical on two different organization credentials, which
//     rules out a per-credential grant problem.
//
// The note is worded for both, so it names no scope: the second form carries
// none, and a note quoting a string absent from the error reads as a mismatch.

// 2026-09-01 on, which is the failure the annotation exists to prevent.
//

// can legitimately mean a malformed purchase order, and a bare invalid_scope
// from somewhere else is not this bug. A false positive has to cost a paragraph
// rather than a confidently wrong exclusive explanation. The old form needs both
// its markers for that reason; the new one names the service outright, so the
