// The generated commands are covered: gatewayOps in generator/gateway/overrides_test.go
// builds its operation list from parser.ParseSpec over specs/*.yaml, so every
// path a generated command sends is checked against the coverage manifest, and
// the generators stamp jamf:gateway on whatever the gateway does not publish.
//
// A hand-written command's path is structurally invisible to all of that. It is
// a string literal in a .go file that no spec describes and no annotation
// covers, so a version withdrawal reaches it only when someone greps. That is
// how twelve files kept sending /v3/computers-inventory after the surviving
// version became v4: the manifest published only v4, nothing refused the
// request, v3 still answered on the wire, and the mocks in the tests were keyed
// off the code rather than the published surface, so correcting one file broke
// six tests.
//
// These two tests close that. They read the committed manifest rather than
// gateway.Lookup alone, because Lookup answers from the `unserved` table, which
// is deliberately the intersection of "the gateway omits it" and "a generated
// command sends it" — a withdrawn version no generated command sends any more
// is absent from that table and therefore looks Served. The manifest's `spec`
// section is the whole published surface, so a path missing from it is the
// question actually being asked.
