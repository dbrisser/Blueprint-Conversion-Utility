// lines at -v, headers at -vv, bodies at -vvv. Plumbed into the SDK via
// WithHTTPClient so spec-generated commands log the same way as hand-written
// Pro commands.
//
// It also labels retries, which nothing else can. This transport sits *below*
// retryablehttp, so it already sees every attempt — but a retry sequence came
// out as N identical request/response pairs with nothing saying they were
// retries and no timing, so a bounded 15s of backoff still read as the CLI
// looping or hanging. The SDK's own RequestLogHook does not help here: it emits
// through the SDK's Logger interface, whose LogRequest carries only method, URL
// and body, so the attempt number and the wait cannot travel through it — the
// hook exists for consumers that log *only* via that interface (the Terraform
// provider's tflog, which is not a RoundTripper) and would merely duplicate
