// DocumentedStatus names a non-2xx response that an operation documents as a
// *result* rather than a failure: the status the server answers, and the error
// code its body must carry for that reading to apply.
//
// The error code is part of the match on purpose. Allowing a bare status would
// mean any 404 on the endpoint renders as success, including one caused by a
// path or tenant mistake, and a wrong answer with a zero exit code is the
// failure mode that is hardest to notice.

	// carrying an answer in its body. The response is an error envelope
	// ({httpStatus, traceId, errors}), not the shape the endpoint returns when
	// the setting exists, so rendering it would make one command emit two
	// unrelated schemas depending on state — and its traceId changes per call,
	// so the output would not even be stable between two identical reads.
	// An empty object is rendered instead: same schema family, deterministic,
	// and every field the caller would read comes back null.

// DoExpectDocumented performs a request whose failure statuses include some the

// Jamf Security Cloud's DNS search domain is the case this exists for: the
// tenant either has a search domain or it does not, and "does not" is answered
// as 404 SEARCH_DOMAIN_NOT_SET. Reported as an error, the ordinary empty state
// of a singleton settings endpoint exited 1 and printed a traceId, so a script
// asking "is a search domain configured?" could not tell "no" from "the request
// broke".
//
// Mirrors documentedStatusResults in the Jamf Pro generator, which does the same
// job through registry.WithAllowedStatuses; the platform transport has no
// allowed-status hook, so the mapping happens here on the way back out.
