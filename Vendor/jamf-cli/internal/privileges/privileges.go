// Package privileges renders a set of Jamf Platform API capability permissions
// into the words Jamf Account prints beside its checkboxes.
//
// It exists because the two vocabularies a 403 can be about are not
// interchangeable, and neither is derivable from the other. A Jamf Pro instance
// enforces API-role privileges with names like "Read Categories"; the platform
// gateway enforces GA capability permissions like categories:read, granted in
// Jamf Account when the API integration is created. The GA consolidation mapped
// several pre-GA privileges onto one capability, so no per-row translation
// exists in either direction — the only correct thing to do is print the
// vocabulary that matches the credential in hand, which is why the caller
// selects the source (see EnrichPrivilegeError) rather than this package
// guessing.
//
// The capability slugs come from a spec — specs/gateway/coverage.json for Pro
// and Classic through the gateway, x-required-privileges for Platform commands.
// catalogue.go turns a slug into a section and permission name, and nothing
// else in here invents a requirement.

// Requirement is one row of Jamf Account's permission picker: the section, the
// permission name, and every action on it the caller needs. One row per
// capability rather than one per capability-action pair, because that is how
// the picker presents it — a permission with a checkbox per action — which
// collapses an ordinary CRUD run into a single row.
//
// Slugs holds the capability permissions that produced the row, in the form the
// spec declared them. It is rendered alongside the names because the names are
// what a human ticks and the slugs are what an error message from the gateway,
// or the commands catalog, will say.
