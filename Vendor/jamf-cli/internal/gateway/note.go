// instanceRemedy is the only thing an operator can actually do about an endpoint
// the gateway does not carry: send it to Jamf Pro directly. Nothing in this CLI
// can route around it.
const instanceRemedy = "Run it against a Jamf Pro instance directly — a profile whose url is your instance and whose auth-method is oauth2 or token."

// transitionalNote explains an endpoint that is outside the published surface
// but may still answer today. Said without a date, because none is published:
// the claim is that the surface is the contract, not that a particular build
// removes the route.
const transitionalNote = "The gateway still routes some endpoints its published API omits, so this one may answer today — that is transitional, and a workflow built on it will break without notice."

// successor names the command that replaces one the gateway refuses, where the
// replacement already ships in this same binary. Curated by hand and
// deliberately tiny: the specs' own `deprecated: true` is dropped on the floor by
// the generator, so nothing derives this, and a wrong answer here is worse than
// no answer — it sends an operator to a command that is not the one they wanted.
//
// The table earns its place because the alternative remedy is disproportionate.
// instanceRemedy tells an operator to provision a second credential; where an
// entry exists, swapping one command name is enough, and the binary they
// already have serves it on the profile they already have.
//
// It cannot be allowed to go stale, and nothing in a spec drop announces that a
// successor has moved or that a key has stopped being refused, so the guard is a
// test: internal/commands' TestGatewaySuccessorsNameCommandsTheBinaryShips fails
// when an entry's key or its replacement names a command the tree does not carry,
// and when a key is no longer refused at all.

// successors is keyed on a refused command path without the binary name. A key
// covers itself and everything beneath it, longest key first, so one entry
// answers for a whole resource's subcommands.
var successors = map[string]successor{
	// Empty, and that is the answer rather than an omission. Every one of the
	// refused commands this binary ships was checked for a replacement and none
	// has one: api-roles, api-integrations, api-role-privileges,
	// api-authentication, jamf-pro-initialization, sso-oauth-session-tokens,
	// environment-type, macos-managed-software-updates' available-updates,
	// classic-computer-configs, and the device actions on POST /v2/mdm/commands.
	// The gateway publishes no substitute for any of them, so instanceRemedy is
	// the whole of the answer there.
	//
	// It held one entry: `pro static-computer-groups`, the withdrawn v2 of a
	// resource whose v3 shipped under a second command name, because a per-file
	// spec layout named each version's file separately. Resource identity comes
	// from the spec's paths and tags now, so both versions land in one resource,
	// deduplicateVersionedOps keeps the v3 the gateway publishes, and there is
	// no v2 command left to refuse or redirect. The rename removed the need for
	// the redirect rather than invalidating it.
	//
	// Deliberately not here either: the standalone erase-device-computers and
	// remove-computer-mdm-profiles resources. Both were refused, and pro.go
	// removed them from the tree outright in favour of the hand-written
	// `pro comp erase` / `remove-mdm`, so there was no command left for an
	// operator to be refused on and nothing to point anywhere. Those names no
	// longer exist at all now; the actions sit inside `computer-inventory`.
	//
	// The rendering is still exercised: internal/gateway's tests install a
	// test-local entry, which is this package's idiom for a mechanism whose
	// live case resolved (see generator/gateway's probedUnserved tests). What
	// cannot be exercised from a table-independent angle is asserted through the
	// delegation instead — internal/commands checks that the refusal, the
	// --help caveat and the catalog all render whatever this table holds rather
	// than composing an answer of their own.
