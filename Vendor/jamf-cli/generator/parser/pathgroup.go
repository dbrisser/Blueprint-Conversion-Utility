// A resource's identity comes from the URL paths it serves, not from the name
// of a file someone put those paths in.
//
// The spec files under specs/ used to decide it: a single-family spec was named
// from its filename and a multi-family one from its paths, so `pro
// static-computer-groups` existed because of `StaticComputerGroups.yaml` — a
// string that appears in no spec and is upstream's jss module filename. Four
// things followed from that filename with nothing stating them: the command
// name, the endpoint-version family the resource joined (keyed on a `-vN`
// suffix), whether an upstream `-preview` tag reached a command, and whether the
// splitter could delete the file. Splitting one document into 165 files to carry
// that is overkill; grouping the paths directly says the same thing and says it
// from the spec.
//
// It also removes two whole classes of bug rather than guarding against them.
// Version consolidation stops depending on a filename suffix — every version of
// a path lands in one group and the highest wins, which is what the CLI wanted
// when a mis-keyed family cost it the v4 computer-inventory endpoints. And
// preview suppression keys on the operation's tag rather than on a filename
// happening to name the canonical resource, which is what kept 17 `-preview`
// tags out of the command surface by accident.
