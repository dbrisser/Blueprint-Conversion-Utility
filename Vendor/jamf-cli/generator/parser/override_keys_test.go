// resource-keyed or path-keyed and nothing in a Go map type says which, so the
// only honest options are a hand list or no guard at all.
// TestResourceKeyedOverrideListIsComplete is the second half — it fails when a
// new resource-keyed table is added and not listed.

// TestEveryResourceKeyedOverrideNamesALiveResource is the guard that was

//
// These tables are consulted as `table[r.Name]`, so a key that names no
// resource is not an error — it is a lookup that misses, and the generator
// falls back to whatever it would have done with no override at all. Nothing
// reports it: `make generate` exits 0, the commands still ship, and the only
// symptom is at the wire.
//
// Every one of these was live when spec-derived naming renamed the resources
// underneath the keys:
//
//   - packages: `--name` filtered on `name`, which /v1/packages refuses outright
//     (400 INVALID_FIELD naming packageName among the filterable fields), so
//     `pro packages delete --name x` and `apply` both failed.
//   - computer-inventory: lost `general.name` and `--serial`/`--udid`, its
//     table columns, its default --section set and its detail-path pin, the
//     detector answering `displayName` off a nested configuration-profile
//     schema instead.
//   - app-installers-titles: lost `titleName`, which CLAUDE.md records as
//     wire-verified and needed precisely because the published spec marks that
//     field readOnly. The titles collection declares no filter parameter, so
//     the field name is the whole match and all 363 titles reported
//     "no resource found".
//   - inventory-preload-records: lost `serialNumber`.
//   - volume-purchasing-locations and device-enrollments: lost `--token-file`
//     entirely, so the only route for a VPP service token or a DEP `.p7m` was
//     to paste it into a JSON body — a credential the CLI exists to keep out of
//     argv.
//
// A rename is exactly when a name-keyed table needs re-keying and exactly when
// nobody thinks to, which is why this is asserted rather than reviewed.
