// than tabulated.
//
// Which sub-paths are independently writable decides how deep a command sits,
// so a spec drop that adds a `DELETE` to a sub-path — or takes a `PUT` away —
// moves commands. Nothing else reports that: `make generate` exits 0 and the
// renamed command simply appears at a different depth, which is exactly how the
// filename-derived names went wrong for years.
//
// Both halves are asserted. The admitted set is nine, listed with the endpoint
// that qualified each one. The excluded set is every other no-param sub-path
// answering more than one method — the candidates that *look* like objects —
// because a rule is only pinned by what it refuses.
