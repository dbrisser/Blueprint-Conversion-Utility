// Keyed by "{METHOD} {gateway path}" with parameters normalised to {}; a bare
// path with no method covers every method at or beneath it.
//
// Note what a 403 can and cannot establish, because the intuitive reading is
// wrong. An unrouted path and an under-privileged one are byte-identical:
// /pro/v1/definitely-not-a-real-endpoint and /pro/v1/auth both answer 403 with
// the same {httpStatus, traceId, errors} body, the same BAD_PERMISSIONS code and
// the same headers, differing only in the trace id. A bare Tyk
// "404 page not found" distinguishes an unknown *namespace*
// (/nosuchnamespace/v1/x) and nothing finer. So an entry here needs corroboration
// — the same credential reaching the rest of the namespace in the same run,
// across regions — not just one 403.
// Empty, and it was not always: /pro/v1/app-installers held the only entry for
// three months. That is the shape to expect an entry to end in. It was probed
// unrouted on EU and US on 2026-08-28 and re-probed on 2026-08-31, both times
// against a credential reading the rest of the namespace in the same run — and
// the reason was never a gateway defect: the surface sits under hiddenapi/ in
// jamf/jss, so no bundle published it and no route existed. public-apis-oas#430
// published all 23 operations on 2026-09-03 and the gateway opened the same day
// (verified here: GET /pro/v1/app-installers/titles returns 363 titles on EU
// against a bogus-path 403 control in the same run), so the manifest now
// declares them and the entry would refuse a working surface.
//
// Which is the argument for the test that asserts every key still matches a
// shipped path: nothing in a spec announces that routing has landed, and a
// stale entry here keeps refusing an endpoint that works.

// Empty, and the bar for adding to it is high. It is NOT for "the wire says this
// still works": several endpoints the spec omits do answer today —
// /pro/v1/api-roles returns 15 roles, /pro/v1/api-integrations 81, and
// /pro/v1/api-role-privileges/search and /pro/v2/mdm/commands answer Jamf's own
// 400 — and that is exactly the transitional state the refusal exists to get
