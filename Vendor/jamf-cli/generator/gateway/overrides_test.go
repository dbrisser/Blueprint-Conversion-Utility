// gatewayOps is every request this CLI can send, modern and Classic.

// The consolidation passes have to run, not just ParseSpec. Three spec files
// declare computers-inventory at v2, v3 and v4 and only one of them becomes a
// command; parsing alone counts all three, so a version this CLI cannot send is
// weighed as heavily as one it does — and the withdrawn versions are exactly
// what a gateway spec drop removes. Left out, the refusal count read 105 of 811
// where the shipped surface accounts for 46, and the ratio guard below fired on
// resources that are not commands.
//
// Only the passes that decide which resource survives or rewrite a path are
// replayed, in generator/main.go's order. The rest set names, columns and
// lookup fields, none of which a verdict reads.
// Built once per test binary. Three tests in this file need the same fixture and
// each rebuild parsed all 165 specs again — four fifths of this package's wall
// time was that redundancy, multiplied by the race detector's bookkeeping over
// allocation-heavy YAML. The memoized value is plain value data and gatewayOps
// hands out a copy, so one test cannot contaminate another's view.
