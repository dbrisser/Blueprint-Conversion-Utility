```

Key types in templates: `parser.Resource` (`Name`, `NameSingular`, `GoName`, `Operations`, `IsSingleton`), `parser.Operation` (`Name`, `Method`, `Path`, `IsList`, `IsPaginated`, `IsDestructive`), `classic.ClassicResource`. `IsPaginated` (any GET with `page`/`page-size` params) is broader than `IsList` (list/history only) and gates `--all`/`--limit` auto-pagination so report/action GETs like `patch-report` page through all results.

`ParseSpec` returns `[]*Resource` — most specs produce one, but multi-family specs (e.g. `SelfServiceBranding.yaml`) produce one per family. `IsSingleton` is true for settings-style resources (GET+PUT, no `{id}`) — they get `get` instead of `list`, skip `apply`.

**A resource's name does not tell you which API version it serves, and reading it that way cost the CLI its newest computer inventory endpoint.** Version consolidation happens at two levels: `deduplicateVersionedOps` picks between paths *inside* one spec file, and `DeduplicateVersioned` picks between *resources* across files, keyed on the `-v-{N}s` suffix the parser derives from a file like `ComputersInventoryV3.yaml`. The second one used to treat a resource whose name carries no suffix as the family's legacy base and suppress it outright. That is right for `inventory-preload`, whose base file declares v1; it is wrong for `computers-inventory`, whose base file declares **v1 and v4 together** — so the within-file pass leaves it holding v4, under a name with no suffix, and it lost to the `-v-3s` sibling. Every `pro computers-inventory` command sent `/v3`, and the two v4-only operations (`erase`, `remove-mdm-profile`) were never generated at all.

Nothing failed, which is why it stood: v3 answers on an instance, and the gateway published all four versions. What surfaced it is the gateway's 11.31.0 spec withdrawing v1, v2 and v3 — the version this CLI happened to send became the one refused before a request is sent, and the version it had all along became the only one served. `DeduplicateVersioned` now ranks a family by the version each resource actually serves, read off its operation paths (`resourceAPIVersion`, the highest rank among them), with the name suffix only saying which resources are in the family. `TestDeduplicateVersioned_BaseWinsWhenItServesTheHigherVersion` pins the computers-inventory shape and `..._BaseStillLosesWhenItIsOlder` pins inventory-preload's, because the fix has to not flip the case the old rule was written for.

**Two computers-inventory paths are still version-pinned by hand and do not move with it.** `resourceGetDetailPathOverrides` (`generator/parser/parser.go`) names the detail endpoint `get` uses when `--section` is absent, and `newComputerEraseCmd`/`newComputerRemoveMDMCmd` (`internal/commands/pro_device_actions.go`) assemble their own paths. All three read `/v3` or `/v1` after the ranking fix moved the resource to v4 — a working `get` on a withdrawn detail path, and two destructive commands on withdrawn v1 paths.

**The hand-written commands held the same stale literals, in thirteen files, and there is now a test that sees them.** The sweep after the ranking fix covered the generated commands, `resourceGetDetailPathOverrides` and `pro_device_actions.go`; `pro audit` (four call sites), `pro device`, `pro classic app-usage`, eight `pro report` subcommands and — the one that made the others hard to fix — **`internal/resolve/resolve.go`**, which holds the device lookup every `pro` command shares, all still sent `/v3/computers-inventory`. Nothing caught it: `gatewayOps` builds its op list from `parser.ParseSpec` over `specs/*.yaml`, so a hand-written path is structurally invisible to `TestAlmostEveryRequestResolvesAsServed` despite that helper's comment claiming it covers "every request this CLI can send", and the pre-flight refusal reads an annotation only the generators stamp. Worse, the *tests* pinned the stale value — correcting `pro_device_resolve.go` broke six of them, because the mocks' route tables were keyed off the code rather than the published surface. v3 answers 200 today, so this was the transitional state the whole refusal mechanism exists for, reached with no refusal and no hint.

`TestHandWrittenPathsAreServed` (`internal/commands/gateway_handwritten_paths_test.go`) greps `internal/commands` and `internal/resolve` for `/vN/` and `/JSSResource/` literals and checks each one. **It reads `specs/gateway/coverage.json`'s `spec` section rather than calling `gateway.Lookup`**, and that distinction is the whole point: the `unserved` runtime table is the intersection of "the gateway omits it" and "a generated command sends it", so a withdrawn version no generated command sends any more resolves as *Served* — a `Lookup`-based test would have passed on all thirteen files. `unservedHandWrittenPaths` is its allowlist, each entry carrying why no successor exists, and a stale entry fails the test. Grep for a hard-coded version whenever a resource's winning version changes; the test now covers the command files, but there is still no test that can see a stale literal in an override table.

The v4 arrival also collided head-on: the generated `erase` landed beside the hand-written one, and `pro comp --help` listed the name twice. `pro.go` now `replaceSubcommand`s `erase` and drops the generated `remove-mdm-profile` in favour of the hand-written `remove-mdm` — the hand-written pair target by serial, name or group, confirm the action, honour `--dry-run` and carry the Find My PIN body, where the generated pair take an `<id>`. A duplicate subcommand name is not a choice cobra can make, so a new generated action that shadows a hand-written one has to be resolved in `pro.go`, not left to resolve itself.

See `generator/README.md` for full template reference.

### Generated Command Features

Generated commands automatically get: `apply` (name-based upsert); `get`/`update`/`delete`/`patch` with `--name` (and per-resource `--serial`/`--udid`) for single-`{id}` paths; `patch` with JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7386) + `--set key=value` + shell completion of scalar fields; `--scaffold` on `create`/`update`/`patch` (rendered by `parser.ScaffoldJSON`, shared by all three generators — it skips read-only fields, keeps write-only ones, prefers a spec example over a placeholder, and shows one element inside an array whose element is an object). When a spec declares BOTH a per-`{id}` x-action and a collection-level sibling at the same path minus `{id}` (e.g. `/deployments/{id}/computers/installation-retry` + `/deployments/computers/installation-retry`), `pairCollectionBulkActions` (in `parser.go`, run before name disambiguation) drops the bulk op and records its path on the per-`{id}` op as `BulkActionPath`; the template then adds an `--all` flag that hits the collection-level endpoint in one server-side call instead of the `{id}` one. Each generated Pro and Platform command also carries a `jamf:privileges` annotation (populated from `x-required-privileges` in the spec via `opAnnotations`) surfaced in the `commands -o json` catalog as a `privileges` array; and appended to the 403 hint at runtime by `EnrichPrivilegeError` — in the vocabulary of whichever API served the command (see the 403 vocabulary note under the gateway-coverage section). Classic commands carry no privilege data. All behavior lives in the templates — don't re-document here, read `generator/parser/generator.go`.

**The synthesized `apply` carries a gateway verdict of its own, and it is not the union of its siblings'.** `applyGatewayAnn` used to emit only `jamf:gateway-privileges`, never `jamf:gateway`/`-basis`/`-detail`, and `checkAPIMatch` refuses only on the first of those — so on a wholly-refused resource every sibling verb was refused pre-flight while `apply` went out to the wire. That is the wrong one to leave open: `apply` is the "building a workflow" command the refusal exists to protect, and the operator was told the endpoint was outside the supported API by `list` and allowed to upsert against it in the same breath. `applyGatewayVerdict` now reads the **first refused operation in send order** (`list`, then `create` or `update` — `applyGatewayOpNames`), mirroring the Classic generator's `gatewayAnn $ "list" "POST" "PUT"`; first rather than merged, for the same reason `classicGatewayVerdict` picks one. A refused `apply` also emits **no** gateway privileges, since a resource whose `list` is withdrawn can still declare scopes on the `create` it kept, and a refused command must not advertise a grant that cannot make it work. `TestApplyCarriesTheSameVerdictAsItsSiblings` replays the whole parse → dedupe → `gateway.Apply` pipeline over the live specs and fails if no wholly-refused apply-shipping resource is left to exercise it.

**A hand-written command can be stamped with the same verdict.** `markGatewayCoverage` (`internal/commands/pro_device_actions.go`) reads the runtime table and applies `jamf:api`/`jamf:gateway`/`-basis`/`-detail` for a method and path the command assembles itself, so `checkAPIMatch` refuses it pre-flight and the `--help` caveat appears. It exists because `POST /v2/mdm/commands` is unpublished: the generated `pro mdm-commands create` was refused while fifteen hand-written computer and mobile-device actions POSTed the identical path unannotated — so the operator was told the endpoint was out of the supported API and could then bulk-issue it across a group. Derived from the table rather than hardcoded, so the refusal disappears by itself if the gateway publishes the method. Do **not** reach for it on a fan-out command where only one of many endpoints is refused (`pro overview`, `pro group-tools analyze`): refusing the whole command to report one resource is the over-correction, and the response-side `gatewayUnservedNote` already covers that case.

**Every classic write takes `--from-file`, not just `apply`.** Classic `create` and `update` read their XML body from `--from-file` or, absent the flag, stdin (`readClassicBody` in `classic_registry.go`; the flag is registered by `classicResourceTemplate`). Stdin alone was unreachable for the callers that most need these commands: AutoPkg's `JamfCLIRunner` passes a body either as `--from-file` or as a `data` dict it serialises to **JSON**, and a JSON body on a `/JSSResource` path is sent with `Content-Type: application/xml` and refused — so a resource with no name-resolution collection (`classic-computer-invitations` and friends, which get no `apply`) had no file-based route at all. The body may hold credentials — an SMTP or LDAP account password — so it belongs in a file, never in a flag value or `argv`.

**Classic writes now carry `--scaffold`, `--set` and field help, from a committed schema artifact.** The manifest describes URLs and says nothing about bodies, so `specs/classic/schemas.json` — derived by `generator/classicschema` from the SDK's `classic_api_resource_documentation.json`, the same file gateway coverage reads — supplies the shape. 44 of 54 manifest resources bind a schema; 114 of 117 classic `create`/`update`/`apply` commands gained both flags (counted from the built binary after the v2082 ingest restored the patch family). The unbound one is `computerconfigurations` (dead); `patchsoftwaretitles` was unbound while v1993 had its reads withdrawn and binds again as of the v2082 ingest, so `classic-patch-titles` writes now carry `--scaffold`, `--set` and enum help. Refresh with `make sync-gateway-coverage-from-sdk` — **one target derives both artifacts**, since a second flag that must always carry the same value is a code path nothing exercises alone; `make verify-classic-schemas` is the CI-safe guard. Full reasoning in `docs/solutions/conventions/classic-body-schemas-2026-09-02.md`.

**This matters more on Classic than the same gap would elsewhere, because the API hides a mistake rather than reporting it.** Wire-checked 2026-09-02: an unrecognised element answers **201 and is silently dropped**; an out-of-enum value answers **201 and reads back the default** (`frequency: "Twice per fortnight"` → `Once per computer`; a criterion's `and_or: "maybe"` → `and`); a missing required field answers 409 with the right field named *inside an HTML error page*, one field at a time. So a caller who guesses gets a working object that does the wrong thing, with no response field revealing it. Hence `--set` refuses an unknown field and an out-of-enum value — the only validation the CLI does that the server does not — and `--help` renders the enum list, which is the part the wire will not teach you.

Four rendering facts, none derivable from the resource name:

- **The repeated-element wrapper is collapsed, and the element name is never derivable from the array's name.** Classic models `<criteria><criterion>…</criterion></criteria>` as an array of single-key objects, and 97 of the 373 repeated elements are not a naive singularisation (`criteria`→`criterion`, `smart_groups`→`group`). Read it off the schema (`parser.ClassicRepeatedElement`). **And the spec is not always right about it, which no amount of reading it off the schema catches.** `os_x_configuration_profile.scope.jss_user_groups` declared `<jss_user_group>` where the wire answers `<user_group>` — an upstream typo confined to one property, since all seven sibling resources carrying the same scope block declare `user_group`, and so does that same resource's own `scope.exclusions.jss_user_groups`. Corrected in the SDK's `propertyRenames` and ingested at v0.22.1, which is why `classic-macos-config-profiles create --scaffold` now renders the targets position the same way it always rendered the exclusions one. The read side is where this bites: a generated Classic type leaves `XMLName xml.Name` untagged, so a mismatched child decodes to nothing and the call reports success — the scoped user group was silently dropped on every decode. The write side is lenient, and both spellings persist and read back as `user_group`. So a repeated-element name is worth spot-checking against a sibling that carries the same block, and against the resource's own exclusions half, rather than trusting one declaration.
- **The same spec uses a second modelling for the same XML**: `policy.scripts` is an *object* holding a `script` array plus `size`, where `policy.criteria` is an *array of wrappers*. A renderer handling only the first emits the second a level short.
- **`size` is overloaded**: 102 of its 104 occurrences are the server-computed collection counter, but `computer_post`'s `hardware.storage[].device.size` is a capacity in MB. `parser.ClassicIsCountElement` discriminates on a repeated sibling, and `TestNoBoundResourceCarriesASemanticSizeField` fails if an ingest ever binds the resource where that test is wrong.
- **Every `id` is kept.** A body `id` is inert — a create sending `<id>99999</id>` was assigned 226, and a PUT to `/id/228` carrying `<id>229</id>` updated 228 — and most `id` elements in a Classic body are foreign keys the caller supplies, so a rule stripping them would have to tell identity from reference.

**The write-shaped `*_post` schema wins where the spec declares one**, and 13 of the 15 are orphaned — no operation references them. They differ from their read counterparts only in `xml` and `required`, which is exactly what is needed: `computer_group_post` requires `[name, is_smart]` where `computer_group` declares no top-level `required` at all, and both are enforced on the wire. Three declare no `xml.name`, so the root falls back to the key with `_post` stripped — without that a body would be wrapped in `<ldap_server_post>`.

**`--set` builds the whole body and is mutually exclusive with `--from-file`**, unlike the Platform and Security Cloud `--set` which overlay onto a `--from-file` body. Overlaying would mean parsing, merging and re-marshalling the caller's XML, and a config-profile body carries a mobileconfig inside CDATA that PI-827 says the server extra-decodes — a round trip through a generic XML map is how a payload gets mangled. It is also unnecessary: **a Classic PUT is a partial update** (wire-checked — a body of just `<name>` renamed a network segment and left its address range, override flags and a group's whole `criteria` array intact), so `--set` alone is a valid update with no fetch-merge cycle. Piped stdin is a *warning* rather than a refusal, because "stdin is not a character device" is true of the empty stdin a CI runner hands every process — refusing failed `create --set name=x` in exactly the automated case `--set` exists for.

**Classic `--set` refuses a credential field, and it is the only one of the four `--set` implementations that enforces the credential policy.** The modern Pro generator's only related mechanism is a data-loss *warning* that recommends `--set password=<value>` as the remedy. On Classic the exposure is wide — a distribution point, SMTP server, LDAP server, directory binding, VPP account and disk-encryption configuration all carry one. Matched on the field name **and** a string type, because a distribution point declares `username_password_required`, a boolean switch whose name contains "password"; refusing that would block a legitimate setting. Credential fields are also kept out of shell completion.

**A credential field is matched on its leaf name *or* its full dotted path.** `credentialFieldNames` alone missed three string-typed secrets: `json_web_token_configuration.encryption_key` (the JWT signing key — `classic_jwt_configs.go` carried no `Credentials` map at all, and `buildClassicXMLFromSet`'s only gate is `if spec.Credentials[key]`, so nothing refused it) and `disk_encryption_configuration.institutional_recovery_key.{key,data}` (the base64 `.p12` institutional FileVault keystore and its key material — only `.password` and `.password_sha256` were refused). All three were offered by shell completion, which is the part that walks a caller into it. The leaf names `key` and `data` are far too broad to substring-match, hence `credentialFieldPaths`, matched on a path suffix so the same object stays refused if a future schema nests it. `TestEverySecretBearingFieldIsRefusedForSet` sweeps `specs/classic/schemas.json` for any string-typed field whose name or path names a key, token or secret and requires each to be refused, with four exemptions that each carry a reason (type discriminators like `key_type`, and `institutional_recovery_key.certificate_type`); a stale exemption fails, and so does a vacuous walk. Note the string-type gate is still what keeps `username_password_required` — a boolean switch on a distribution point — settable, so the sweep never demands a boolean be refused.

**`--set` refuses an empty value for an enum field**, which used to be the one value it waved through: the guard read `if values, ok := spec.Enums[key]; ok && raw != ""`, and `""` is out of range for every enum in the table. So `--set general.frequency="$FREQ"` with `FREQ` unset sent `<frequency></frequency>`, the Classic API answered 200, and the policy's execution frequency was silently changed to `Once per computer` — the guard firing for the typo and not for the empty variable, which is the more common CI mistake. The refusal names the legal set and says to omit the flag instead, since a shell variable that expanded to nothing is the usual cause. A **non**-enum field still takes `key=` and still renders an empty element, because clearing a field is a legitimate edit.

**Two traps worth not repeating.** Cobra validates `Args` before `RunE`, so a classic `update` on an id-only resource refused `update --scaffold` with "accepts 1 arg(s), received 0" and never reached the template — `classicScaffoldArgs` relaxes the validator only when the flag is set. **The modern Pro `update` escapes it and the rest of that generator did not**, which is issue 363: `update` has a `--name` alternative and is `MaximumNArgs(1)` anyway, but a `patch` or an `x-action` under a path parameter with no name lookup got a bare `ExactArgs(N)` and its `--scaffold` was unreachable — 26 leaves, `pro enrollment-customization-panels update` under two parameters. `resourceTemplate` now emits the same floor-only relaxation inline (`MaximumNArgs(N)` under `flagScaffold`, `ExactArgs(N)` otherwise), which is safe for all 26 because the template already places the scaffold return as the first statement of `RunE`, ahead of every `args[…]` read. **Only the floor moves in all three generators**: dropping the validator instead lets `patch a b c --scaffold` print the template and discard three positionals, which is issue 350 reached through a flag, and `TestScaffoldKeepsTheDeclaredPositionalCeiling` now fails at both ends rather than holding the too-strict half as a count. And the scaffold must bypass the output formatter: classic commands default to pretty-printed XML, so routing an already-indented template through `ctx.Output.PrintBytes` returned it double-spaced.

**The spec is right about XML roots and the manifest is not, twice, and one of them is a live bug this work did not fix.** An account group's wire root is `<group>` and an account user's is `<account>`, against the manifest's invented `account_group` and `account_user`. Since `Singular` is also the JSON unwrap key, `classic-account-groups get 8 -o json` returns `{"group": {...}}` while every other classic `get` returns the object flat. Correcting it changes the output shape of two commands, so it is reported by the derivation as a warning and left alone.

**A Self Service category is stored only if the body carries `display_in`, and the wire reports nothing when it does not.** Wire-checked on Jamf Pro 11.31.1 (2026-09-07) across all six Classic resources carrying a `self_service.self_service_categories` block: a `<category>` holding only `<id>`, or `<id>` plus `<name>`, or `<feature_in>` without `<display_in>`, is **accepted with 201 and silently discarded**; `display_in=true` persists; `display_in=false` is a *deletion* gesture rather than a stored value. That law is a property of the relation, identical on all six. `mobile_device_configuration_profile` was the one resource whose spec `$ref`'d the shared `category` schema (`{id, name, priority}`) instead of declaring the item inline with `display_in`, so the field was unreachable from a scaffold or `--set` at all; corrected in the SDK's `schemaPatches` and ingested at v0.22.2. **And `display_in` is write-only on that resource alone** — its GET echoes `<id>` and `<name>` only, where the other five echo `display_in` — so nothing can read it back or drift-detect it there, and a consumer reasoning from `os_x_configuration_profile` would be wrong about exactly the resource whose spec was wrong. `feature_in` is deliberately absent from the mobile profile's item: both mobile resources store none, while the four macOS/ebook ones store and echo it defaulted to `false`, so it is a per-resource capability rather than a field the server ignores everywhere. Consequence for `--scaffold`: the boolean placeholder renders `<display_in>false</display_in>`, which is the discard value — the `general.category.id: 0` case below, where the rendered value is guaranteed wrong rather than merely incomplete.

**A policy scaffold cannot be sent unedited, and the failures are worth knowing.** `general.category.id`'s spec example is `0`, which answers `409 No match found for category 0` — the ztna `categoryName: ""` case again, where the rendered value is *guaranteed* invalid rather than merely incomplete. `scope` and `account_maintenance` answer **500**, because their specimen references point at objects that do not exist on the target. The rendering is correct and showing one specimen per optional section is the shared scaffold rule, so the generated help says to delete the sections you do not need.

**Name resolution needs a GET-serving collection.** `apply`, `--name`, `--serial` and `--udid` all work by GETting the resource's collection and RSQL-filtering it, so they are generated only when `nameResolutionPath` (`generator/parser/generator.go`) is non-empty. That is deliberately stricter than `collectionPath`, which answers "what is this resource's collection URL" and to do so falls back to the create-POST path and to the `{id}` path minus its last segment — neither implying the server answers a GET there. Resources whose modern API is POST-collection + GET-`{id}` only (dock-items, venafis, cloud-azure, cloud-ldaps, the PKI settings resources) therefore ship ID-only CRUD: no `--name`, no `apply`. Add a `resourceNameLookupPathOverrides` entry if a sibling endpoint can serve the lookup; that override bypasses the check.

Name-resolution helpers (in `registry.go` / `classic_registry.go`): `readApplyInput`, `extractJSONField`, `resolveNameToIDForApply`, `extractClassicName`, `resolveClassicNameToIDForApply`.


## Named Passes and Helpers

Symbols worth knowing by name, because a change in the wrong one is silent.

**Templates.** `resourceTemplate` (modern), `classicResourceTemplate`
(Classic), `registryTemplate` / `classicRegistryTemplate` (the registries) —
all Go `const` strings embedded in the generator source, not separate `.tmpl`
files.

**Version consolidation.** `deduplicateVersionedOps` picks between paths inside
one resource, keeping the highest version per version-stripped path shape.
`compareAPIVersions` / `apiVersionRank` rank them, and `stripVersionSegments`
reads a version wherever it sits — which fits the gateway, where the version
follows the service namespace (`/securitycloud/v1/groups`) or the tenant, rather
than leading. Ranking by the *leading* segment scored every gateway path 0 and
made "prefer the higher version" a tie decided by map iteration order.

**Bulk pairing.** `pairCollectionBulkActions` / `bulkCandidate` fold a
collection-wide sibling into a command's `--all` instead of shipping two verbs.
The `{id}`-terminal and single-param exclusions are relaxed for `DELETE` alone,
because a collection `DELETE` unambiguously means "all of them" where a
collection `POST` creates and a `PUT` replaces.

**Platform `apply` synthesis.** `buildApplySpec`
(`generator/platform/emitter.go`) composes a resource's own list, collection
POST and item PUT/PATCH. It emits nothing unless all of: an own list path (a
`crossResourceNameLookupPath` means the `{id}` belongs to a sibling, so there is
no collection here to create into), a non-destructive collection POST with a
non-multipart body, an item PUT/PATCH taking exactly one path param, and a
name-ish property actually present in the create body. Six resources qualify.
`PUT` is preferred over `PATCH` where both exist, because replace is what
`apply` means everywhere else. **The name comes out of the body, never a flag**
(`platform.ApplyName`): a `--name` beside it would be a second source of truth
with no correct resolution when the two disagree. **Only a genuine
`ErrNotFound` takes the create branch** — treating an auth error or a 5xx during
the lookup as absence is how a failed read becomes a duplicate.
`platformNoApply` blocklists `blueprints` and `platform-device-groups`, whose
hand-written `apply` commands do strictly more and would otherwise ship a
duplicate subcommand cobra dispatches by declaration order.

**Pagination and list shape.** `hasPaginationParams` gates the auto-pagination
loop, `parser.MaxPageSize` (`generator/parser/pagesize.go`) sizes each page from
the endpoint rather than from `--page-size` — read that file before changing a
page size, it carries the wire evidence and the reason honouring the flag loses
records — and `ListArrayKey` names the property a list response unwraps.
`buildQueryParams` filters `page`/`page-size` **only when the op actually
paginates** — filtering unconditionally, on the reasoning that the loop owns
them, silently deleted `--page-size` from audit's cursor pager and `--page` from
the two DDM report ops.

**Naming and collisions.** `applyPlatformOperationNameOverrides` runs **last**,
after `disambiguateSameTerminalOps`: an override is by definition the final word
on a name, and applying it first let a derivation pass silently undo it —
`resolveNoParamConflicts` renamed *both* sides of a collision and shipped the
stutter `platform audit audit`. `checkOperationNameCollisions` catches two
operations sharing a name; it does **not** catch two specs merging into one
resource, which is what `platformNamespace` is for.
`dropUnroutedPlatformOps` filters `platformUnroutedOps` before name
disambiguation and before the dedup.

**Gateway verdicts.** `subtreeScopes` unions scopes across a Classic resource's
surviving paths, which is why `gatewayPrivAnn` returns nothing for a refused
command — a refused command must not advertise a grant that cannot make it work.
`classicTrailsPro` (`generator/gateway/verdict.go`) gates the "which trails the
Pro API's version" clause in a Classic refusal, so that sentence is told only to
the operator it can mislead; an unparseable version compares equal and withholds
it.

**Runtime helpers the templates emit calls to.** `extractID`, `firstMatch` and
`lookupMatchingIDs` do name resolution; `lookupMatchingIDs` is the client-side
re-fetch path taken when a collection declares no `filter` parameter, where the
field name is the whole match. `SelectTableColumns` narrows a list's columns.
`withGatewayUnservedNote` / `gatewayUnservedNote` is the response-side half of
the gateway refusal, appended rather than substituted and gated on the body
carrying `BAD_PERMISSIONS` or `404 page not found`.
