// ExtractSubtree derives per-resource spec files for one subtree of a
// consolidated Jamf Pro OpenAPI document, leaving every other file in specsDir
// alone.
//
// This exists because one Jamf Pro surface is published only on the gateway.
// App Installers sits under hiddenapi/ in jamf/jss, so the jss bundle and the
// instance's own /api/schema/ monolith both exclude it, and the specs this repo
// generated its commands from were reverse-engineered for exactly that reason.
// public-apis-oas#430 published all 23 operations into the gateway's Jamf Pro
// API spec on 2026-09-03, which is the SDK's api/pro_api.json — the same file
// gateway coverage is derived from. So the authoritative spec now arrives with
// the coverage sync, and these files are derived from it rather than maintained
// by hand.
//
// It is deliberately not Split. Split owns the whole of specsDir: it wipes every
// root *.yaml, routes every path in the document, and partitions components into
// a shared _MonolithLibrary.yaml. Handing it pro_api.json would regenerate all
// 164 specs from the gateway's version-filtered view of the Pro API and delete
// the commands that view has withdrawn. This walks one subtree, writes only the
// files it is given, and inlines each bucket's whole component closure so the
// files are self-contained — a shared library would entangle them with Split's
// wipe-and-regenerate contract, and PreservedSpecs' $ref scan with it.
//
// Three transforms turn a gateway-published operation into a Pro-direct one.
// Each is a property of the publication rather than of the endpoint, so it is
// applied here rather than corrected by hand afterwards:
//
//   - Header parameters are dropped. The gateway declares X-Tenant-Id on every
//     operation; it is the scope this CLI's own client stamps on a request
//     (client.setScopeHeader), never a flag a user supplies, and the parser
//     turns a declared parameter into one.
//   - x-required-privileges-legacy is promoted over x-required-privileges. A
//     Pro command's jamf:privileges annotation speaks Jamf Pro API-role prose
//     ("Read Mac Applications"); the gateway spec's x-required-privileges is
//     the GA capability vocabulary ("applications:read"), which reaches the
//     same command through specs/gateway/coverage.json as jamf:gateway-privileges.
//     Publishing the slug as the Pro privilege would send an operator to a
//     console where that grant does not exist — the same class of wrong answer
//     the two-vocabulary split in internal/privileges exists to prevent.
//   - x-action is stamped on any operation whose path is deeper than its
//     collection path and whose terminal segment is a literal. jss carries
//     x-action and the gateway publication drops it, and the parser needs it to
//     name an operation after its verb: without it POST .../version-update,
//     POST .../installation-retry (both forms) and POST .../deployments all
//     infer "create" and collide, and GET .../titles/{id}/versions collides
//     with the canonical get. Precedent for a GET carrying it is in the repo's
//     own specs (ComputerPrestageScopeV2, PatchSoftwareTitleConfigurations).
//
// Returns the files written (sorted) and any warnings — an operation with no
// legacy privilege list is reported rather than silently published with the
// gateway's slug.
