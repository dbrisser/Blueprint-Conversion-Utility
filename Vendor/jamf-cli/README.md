## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
brew install Jamf-Concepts/tap/jamf-cli
```

### Binary releases

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Jamf-Concepts/jamf-cli/releases).

### From source

Requires Go 1.27 or newer — `go.mod` declares `go 1.27.0`, and the default
`GOTOOLCHAIN=auto` fetches that toolchain if your local one is older.

```bash
go install github.com/Jamf-Concepts/jamf-cli/cmd/jamf-cli@latest
```

## Quick Start

For interactive use, `jamf-cli pro setup` prompts for credentials so nothing is leaked to shell history, and stores them in the system keychain. Environment variables (`JAMF_CLIENT_ID`, `JAMF_CLIENT_SECRET`, etc.) are intended for automation workflows only — avoid setting them in interactive shells.

### Jamf Pro

`pro setup` takes credentials from either of two sources. It asks which at the
first prompt, defaulting to an API client you already made:

```bash
# One-time setup: prompts for a client ID and secret, verifies them, and stores
# them in the system keychain
jamf-cli pro setup --url https://jamf.company.com

# Let jamf-cli create the API role and client for you, using a Jamf Pro account.
# Local and directory accounts are deprecated for cloud-hosted instances
# (estimated removal in the second half of 2027), so prefer the option above.
jamf-cli pro setup --url https://jamf.company.com --credentials create

# Multi-instance setup (MSPs): bootstrap credentials for many instances at once
jamf-cli pro setup --from-file instances.txt --credentials create --scope standard

# Instance health dashboard
jamf-cli pro overview

# List computers
jamf-cli pro comp list -o table

# Extract just the names
jamf-cli pro comp list --field name

# Export inventory
jamf-cli pro comp list -o csv --out-file inventory.csv

# Show the JSON template for creating a building
jamf-cli pro buildings create --scaffold

# Create or update a building by name (upsert)
echo '{"name":"HQ","streetAddress1":"1 Apple Park Way"}' | jamf-cli pro buildings apply

# Apply from a file without confirmation
jamf-cli pro buildings apply --from-file building.json --yes

# Delete a building by name
jamf-cli pro buildings delete --name "HQ" --yes

# Device actions by serial number
jamf-cli pro comp blank-push --serial C02X1234
jamf-cli pro comp redeploy-framework --serial C02X1234
jamf-cli pro comp erase --serial C02X1234 --yes

# Device actions targeting a group
jamf-cli pro comp blank-push --group "All Macs" --yes
jamf-cli pro md unmanage --group "Retired iPads" --yes --confirm-destructive

# Classic API MDM commands
jamf-cli pro comp lock --serial C02X1234 --yes --confirm-destructive
jamf-cli pro md update-inventory --id 42 --yes

# Device deep-dive
jamf-cli pro device C02X1234

# Fleet security report
jamf-cli pro report security -o table

# Run a command against multiple instances
jamf-cli multi --filter 'pro-*' -- pro buildings apply --from-file building.json --yes

# Shareable HTML fleet dashboard (add --full for patch, cleanup and org sections)
jamf-cli dashboard --out-file report.html
```

### Jamf Platform (via Gateway)

```bash
# List blueprints (DDM-based config delivery)
jamf-cli pro blueprints list -o table

# Apply a blueprint by name (creates if new, replaces if existing)
jamf-cli pro blueprints apply --from-file passcode-policy.json

# Compliance benchmarks: list and check device-level compliance
jamf-cli pro compliance-benchmarks list -o table
jamf-cli pro compliance-benchmarks device-results --name "macOS CIS Level 1"

# Cross-product Platform device lookup (auto-detects serial vs UUID)
jamf-cli pro platform-devices get --serial C02X1234
```

See the [Setup Guide](https://github.com/Jamf-Concepts/jamf-cli/wiki/Setup-Guide) for the full walkthrough.

## Features

### Jamf Pro

- **Full API coverage** — Modern API (OpenAPI-generated) and Classic API (`/JSSResource/`) commands
- **`overview`** — Instance dashboard with 37 parallel API calls: inventory, enrollment, MDM, alerts
- **`scope`** — View, add to, and remove from scope on policies, config profiles, restricted software, and apps — no XML editing required
- **Device actions** — Erase, remove MDM, redeploy framework, blank push, DDM sync, renew MDM, lock, enable/disable Remote Desktop (computers); erase, unmanage, restart, shutdown, update inventory (mobile devices). Target by serial number, name, ID, group, or file. Destructive bulk operations require `--confirm-destructive`
- **`device`** — Aggregated device deep-dive: identity, hardware, OS, security posture, user info, MDM command history, policy logs
- **`report security`** — Fleet security posture: FileVault, Gatekeeper, SIP, firewall rates, OS version distribution, flagged devices
- **JCDS file ops** — Upload, download, sync, and list files on the Jamf Cloud Distribution Service: `jamf-cli pro packages upload`, `pro jamf-cloud-distribution-service download`, `pro jamf-cloud-distribution-service sync`, `pro jamf-cloud-distribution-service-files list`

### Jamf Platform (via Gateway)

- **Blueprints** — CRUD, deploy/undeploy, clone, scope management (add/remove device groups by name), component scaffolds, import Classic configuration profiles as blueprints with automatic DDM conversion (passcode policies, Safari settings, software update deferrals, RSR settings, software update preferences are promoted to native DDM components; `--legacy` to skip conversion)
- **Compliance Benchmarks** — Benchmark CRUD, baselines, rules, device compliance results, stats
- **Platform Devices** — Unified device inventory, actions (check-in, erase, restart, shutdown, unmanage)
- **Platform Device Groups** — CRUD, membership management
- **DDM Reports** — Device declaration status, declaration clients

### Jamf Protect

- **Full SDK coverage** — Plans, analytics, analytic sets, exception sets, USB control, telemetry, prevent lists, unified logging filters, roles, users, groups, API clients, and org settings
- **`overview`** — Instance dashboard with 14 parallel API calls: endpoints, security config, data forwarding, access
- **`apply`** — Idempotent upsert: creates or replaces resources by name, with confirmation. `--scaffold` prints an empty JSON template
- **`export` / `import`** — Round-trip configuration as JSON or YAML. Plans and analytic sets use names (not IDs) for portability across tenants
- **Community analytics** — Import YAML analytics from the [jamf/jamfprotect](https://github.com/jamf/jamfprotect) repository
- **Downloads** — Installer packages, configuration profiles (.mobileconfig), and certificates
- **Granular mutations** — Add/remove rules on USB control sets, analytics on sets, exceptions on sets

### Jamf School

- **Full coverage** — Devices, device groups, users, groups, classes, profiles, apps, locations, iBeacons, DEP devices
- **`overview`** — Instance dashboard for the school environment
- **Blueprints + DDM** — Same Platform-Gateway-backed Blueprints and DDM Reports as Jamf Pro, scoped to the school tenant
- **`apply` upsert** — Idempotent name-based create-or-replace across every resource

### Cross-product

- **`--field`** — Extract a single field from any response: `jamf-cli pro comp list --field id`
- **`apply`** — Name-based upsert: creates if new, replaces if existing (with confirmation)
- **`patch`** — JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7386): update individual fields without a full replace. Use `--set key=value` for scalar fields or pipe a merge-patch document. Accepts `--name`, `--serial`, `--udid` (resource-dependent) in place of an ID. `--scaffold` prints the patchable field template
- **`--name` flag** — `get`, `update`, `delete`, and `patch` commands all accept `--name` (and resource-specific alternates like `--serial`, `--udid`) in place of a positional ID. When the value matches more than one record (e.g. two computers sharing a serial after a logic-board swap), the lookup fails with a usage error under `--no-input` (or a non-terminal stdin) and prompts interactively otherwise — it never silently picks one. Run `jamf-cli pro report duplicate-serials` to list the colliding records
- **`--scaffold`** — Print JSON templates for create/update commands with example values
- **Five output formats** — `table`, `json`, `csv`, `yaml`, `plain`
- **Auto-pagination** — `--all` fetches every page; `--limit` caps results
- **Dry-run mode** — `--dry-run` previews writes without executing
- **`--from-file` bulk operations** — `apply`, `delete`, and other write commands accept `--from-file <path>` for newline-separated names or a CSV. Pair with `--yes` and `--confirm-destructive` for unattended bulk cleanup
- **`multi`** — Run any command against multiple profiles: `jamf-cli multi --filter 'pro-*' -- pro comp list`. Supports glob patterns, file input (profile names or URLs), and interactive selection
- **`dashboard`** — One self-contained HTML fleet report across Jamf Pro, Protect and Platform: fleet counts, security posture, OS distribution, check-in compliance, audit findings and environment stats, with `--full` adding patch compliance, hardware models, cleanup analysis and org structure. Use the global `--out-file`; a partially-collected run says so in the document's own header and exits 7. `--include-profile` pulls a second *product* into the same report. `jamf-cli config set-report-dir <dir>` is the prerequisite for the MCP server's `generate_report` tool, which writes the same report and hands a connecting AI its path rather than its contents
- **Destructive safeguards** — Delete and replace operations require `--yes` confirmation
- **`setup`** — Bootstrap API roles and OAuth2 credentials from a username/password. Idempotent (safe to re-run): updates roles and integrations in place without rotating credentials. Use `--rotate-credentials` to explicitly regenerate secrets. Supports multi-instance setup via `--from-file` for MSPs
- **System keychain** — Secrets stored via macOS Keychain or Linux secret-service
- **Jamf Platform Gateway** — Route Jamf Pro through regional gateways with `--tenant-id`

> **The Platform API went GA on 2026-09-03.** If you are coming from the public beta, the
> gateway host, the scope key and the credentials all changed, and a handful of Jamf Pro
> endpoints are no longer served through the gateway. See [The Platform API at
> GA](docs/guides/platform-api-ga.md).

Jamf Pro supports three auth methods: `oauth2`, `token`, and `platform`. Jamf Protect uses `oauth2` only. Three secret formats: `env:VAR`, `file:/path`, `keychain:service/account`.

> **Least privilege:** When creating API roles for use with jamf-cli, grant only the privileges required for the endpoints you need to access. Jamf Pro maps each API endpoint to a specific privilege — consult the [Privileges and Deprecations](https://developer.jamf.com/jamf-pro/docs/privileges-and-deprecations) reference to determine the minimum set of permissions for your workflow.

## Exit Codes

The `exitCodeName` column is the literal string in the `-o json` error
envelope, which is what a script should match on; the meaning is for readers.

| Code | `exitCodeName` | Meaning |
|------|----------------|---------|
| 0 | `success` | Success |
| 1 | `general` | General error |
| 2 | `usage` | Invalid usage |
| 3 | `authentication` | Authentication error |
| 4 | `not_found` | Not found |
| 5 | `permission_denied` | Permission denied |
| 6 | `rate_limited` | Rate limited |
| 7 | `partial_failure` | Partial failure (some items in a batch succeeded) |
| 8 | `unsupported` | Refused by policy — the command is correctly invoked, but the resolved credentials cannot reach the API that serves it |

Exit 8 is what a Jamf Pro or Classic command outside the Jamf Platform gateway's published
API returns on a gateway profile, and what a Platform API command returns on a Jamf Pro
instance profile. It is separate from exit 2 so a script can tell a policy refusal from a
malformed invocation. As a stopgap, `JAMF_CLI_ALLOW_UNPUBLISHED=1` downgrades the first of
those to a warning on stderr and sends the request anyway — see
[the Platform API GA guide](docs/guides/platform-api-ga.md#commands-refused-on-a-gateway-profile).

See [Error Handling & Exit Codes](https://github.com/Jamf-Concepts/jamf-cli/wiki/Error-Handling-&-Exit-Codes) for structured JSON errors, retry logic, and scripting patterns.

## Shell Completion

```bash
jamf-cli completion install
```

Supports bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell. See the [Setup Guide](https://github.com/Jamf-Concepts/jamf-cli/wiki/Setup-Guide#shell-completion) for manual installation.

## Development

```bash
make build       # Build binary
make test        # Run tests
make lint        # Lint code
make generate    # Generate commands from OpenAPI specs
```

See [Architecture & Development](https://github.com/Jamf-Concepts/jamf-cli/wiki/Architecture-&-Development) for project structure and contributing guidelines.


## Troubleshooting

### Debug output

Add `--verbose` (or `-v`) to any command to print HTTP request and response details to stderr:

```bash
jamf-cli pro comp list --verbose
```

To capture debug output to a file:

```bash
jamf-cli pro comp list --verbose 2>debug.log
```

### Authentication errors (exit code 3)

- Run `jamf-cli pro setup` (or `jamf-cli protect setup`) to reconfigure credentials.
- Verify the active profile with `jamf-cli config list`.
- Check that env vars (`JAMF_CLIENT_ID`, `JAMF_CLIENT_SECRET`, `JAMF_URL`) are not overriding your config profile unintentionally.
- For OAuth2, confirm the API client is enabled in Jamf Pro and has the required privileges.

### Not found / permission errors (exit codes 4–5)

- Confirm the resource exists: try a `list` command first.
- Check that the API role has the minimum privileges for the endpoint. See [Privileges and Deprecations](https://developer.jamf.com/jamf-pro/docs/privileges-and-deprecations).

### Rate limiting (exit code 6)

jamf-cli retries automatically with exponential backoff when rate-limited. If you're consistently hitting limits, add `--limit` to reduce page sizes or introduce delays between commands in scripts.

### Previewing changes safely

Use `--dry-run` (`-n`) to see what a write command would do without executing it:

```bash
jamf-cli pro buildings apply --from-file building.json --dry-run
```


### Bugs and feature requests

Please file an issue in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Jamf-Concepts/jamf-cli/issues).


## Changelog

See [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Jamf-Concepts/jamf-cli/releases) for release notes and version history.

[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) covers what an auto-generated list of pull requests cannot:
which changes are breaking, what the migration is, and why. Read it before upgrading if you
automate against this CLI.

For the current release that means [The Platform API at GA](docs/guides/platform-api-ga.md)
— the gateway host, credentials and scope key all changed, a set of Jamf Pro and Classic
commands is now refused on a gateway profile, and its "Other CLI changes" section covers the
breaking changes that are not about the gateway at all (`pro ddm-reports declaration get`
and `device get` removed, `pro comp erase` / `remove-mdm` on v4, `config list` columns, an
empty list printing `[]` rather than `null`).
