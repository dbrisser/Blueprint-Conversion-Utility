// commandEntry is projected into a map by hand before it is printed, so adding
// a field to the struct does not put it in the catalog — and the compiler says
// nothing. This walks the struct's json tags and requires each to appear as a
// key on at least one real command.
//
// Two fields have been lost this way. gatewaySuccessor was computed, stored on
// the struct and never added to the map — dead in the catalog while the runtime
// refusal and the --help caveat both named the successor correctly (fixed in
// #345). And `scopes` was about to go the same way: `commands -o json` reported
// none for all 110 commands carrying the annotation, with every unit test
// passing, because the tests read scopesOf and the annotation directly.
//
// This is the generic half. TestCatalogJSONCarriesTheSuccessorKey is the
// specific one and both are wanted: that test pins gatewaySuccessor's
// positive-only contract in *both* directions (absent for a served command,
// never present-but-empty), which a key-presence sweep cannot see, while this
// one covers a field nobody has written a targeted test for yet.
//
// Run over one reflectively-populated entry rather than the shipped tree. It
// used to sweep the tree, on the argument that a positive-only field is only
// present when some command has a value for it and that a synthetic entry would
// need hand-populating — the same hand-maintained list this test replaces. That
// argument is answered by populating every field through reflection instead of
// by hand: a field added to the struct is populated automatically, so it is
// still the compiler-free half that catches a missing projection, and the test
// no longer depends on the shipped tree happening to carry a value.
//
// The dependency was not hypothetical. gatewaySuccessor is emitted only for a
// refused command with a curated replacement, and the curated table is now
// legitimately empty, so a tree sweep reported the field as unprojected while
// the projection was intact — the guard failing on the absence of live data
// rather than on a defect.
