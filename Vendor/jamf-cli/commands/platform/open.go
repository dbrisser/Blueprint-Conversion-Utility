// radarURL is the Jamf Security Cloud web console. Security Cloud has no

// credentials at all.
const radarURL = "https://radar.wandera.com/"

// proServerURLPath is the Jamf Pro API endpoint naming the instance's own web
// URL. It is only read on a gateway profile: an instance profile already holds
// the URL it authenticated against, and spending a request to be told what we
// dialled would make `pro open` fail for a reason unrelated to opening a
// browser. Served by the gateway (scope jss-url:read; "Read JSS URL" on a Jamf
// Pro API role).
const proServerURLPath = "/v1/jamf-pro-server-url"

// openLongTail documents the two behaviours a caller has to be able to predict:
// when the browser is skipped, and that the URL is always available as data.
const openLongTail = `

The URL is printed instead of opened when --print is passed, when stdin is
not interactive (--no-input), under --dry-run, when a flag asks for it as
data (--out-file, --field, --select), or when stdout is not a
terminal — so
"jamf-cli ... open | pbcopy" and a CI job both give you the URL rather than
trying to launch a browser. Use -o json or --field url to consume it.

$BROWSER overrides the platform's default opener.`

// newProOpenCmd opens the Jamf Pro web interface, at a named section of it.
//
// This is the one `open` that can need a request. It does not carry
// noAuthAnnotation for that reason: on a gateway profile the instance URL is
// not a credential input at all (a platform integration names a tenant, never
// a Jamf Pro host), so it has to be read from the API.
//
// The section is a positional rather than 139 subcommands. Both spell the same
// invocation — `pro open policies` either way — and the choice only shows up
// in the two places that matter: `pro open --help` stays one screen instead of
// listing the whole interface, and `pro --help` keeps one entry. It is also
// what `gh browse <path>` and `stripe open <section>` do. Discoverability
