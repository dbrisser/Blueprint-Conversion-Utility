// The path guard beside this one (TestHandWrittenPathsAreServed) checks that a
// hand-written command sends a path the gateway publishes. It says nothing
// about the *response*, and a version bump can rename a field as readily as it
// can withdraw a path — so the v3→v4 computers-inventory sweep moved thirteen
// path literals and left every reader asking for general.lastContactTime, a
// key ComputerGeneralV4 does not declare. Nothing failed: the reads answered
// "" and the reports rendered a healthy fleet. Reading it as an RSQL filter
// field was worse than silent — v4 answers 400 INVALID_FIELD — so `pro audit`
// reported a failed check on a healthy tenant.
//
// Wire-checked 2026-09-03 against nmartin.jamfcloud.com, one computer, both
// versions minutes apart: v1's general.lastContactTime and v4's
// general.lastCheckIn were the same instant, and v4's general.lastContact was
// null. So lastCheckIn is the rename; lastContact is a new field beside it,
// and substituting it is not a fix — a `<` filter on lastContact matched the
// unfiltered totalCount, which would report the whole fleet as stale.
//
// The guard is deliberately keyed on the *withdrawn* v1 names rather than on
// "every name ComputerGeneralV4 declares". `general` is a variable name shared
// by the policy, mobile-device and package sections, which carry their own
// unrelated fields (general.enabled, general.displayName, general.osVersion),
// so a completeness check over one schema reports those as defects. What is
// knowable from the specs alone, and is exactly this bug class, is the set of
// names v1 declared and v4 does not.

// generalFieldRead matches a read of a `general`-section field in either of
// the two shapes the hand-written commands use.

// withdrawnV1GeneralReads are reads of a v1-only general field that are still
// correct, keyed "<field>@<enclosing function>" with the reason.
//
// Keyed on the site rather than on the field name, because a name-keyed
// exemption exempts the primary read as well as the fallback: with
// "lastContactTime" alone in the table, reverting pro_device.go to read it
// directly still passed. That is the same weakness the review found in
// TestHandWrittenPathsAreServed's matcher — a guard reporting "checked" for a
