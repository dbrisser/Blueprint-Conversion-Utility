An API integration is created at one of three levels in Jamf Account, and its
credential only works with that level:

  organization           SSO, AI Governance — supply neither ID
  platform environment   a group of tenants across product types (preferred)
  tenant                 a single Jamf Pro, School, Protect or Security Cloud
                         tenant (legacy)

Environment and tenant are mutually exclusive; a customer holding several tenants
without a platform environment makes a profile per tenant.
