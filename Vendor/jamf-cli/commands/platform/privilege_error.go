// EnrichPrivilegeError names the permission a 403 wanted, in the vocabulary of
// whichever API served the command.
//
// The two vocabularies are independent sets and neither is derivable from the
// other. A Jamf Pro instance enforces API-role privileges ("Read Categories"),
// granted in Jamf Pro. The Jamf Platform gateway enforces GA capability
// permissions (categories:read), granted in Jamf Account when the API
// integration is created; the GA consolidation folded several Jamf Pro
// privileges into one capability, and Jamf Account no longer offers the old
// names at all. So printing the wrong one sends the operator to a console where
// the grant it names does not exist.
//
// Three cases, in the order they are checked:
//
//   - A Platform command (jamf:api platform-gateway, which covers the
//     gateway-served Security Cloud commands too). Its jamf:privileges
//     annotation is already the capability vocabulary, and its error comes
//     from the platform SDK rather than internal/client, so nothing has mapped
//     it to an exit code yet.
//   - A Pro or Classic command whose 403 hint already carries a platform
//     answer: internal/client wrote it, for the request it actually sent, on a
//     gateway credential. Left alone — appending the Jamf Pro names here is the
//     bug this whole function exists to avoid.
//   - Everything else: a Pro or Classic 403 against a Jamf Pro instance, where
//     the annotation's Jamf Pro privilege names are the right answer.
